# Pincode Map Search Project

## Project Overview
This project visualizes specific location data on a map based on user-input pincode. It allows users to search for a pincode, and it marks the corresponding location on the map, providing details about that location. The project is designed to work with Google Maps API but can also be configured to work offline using OpenStreetMap.

## Key Features
- **Pincode Search**: Users can input a pincode, and the application will locate the corresponding area on the map. The location is marked, and details related to the pincode are displayed.
- **Google Maps API**: The project integrates with the Google Maps API to provide real-time, interactive maps.
- **Offline Map Support**: The project can be configured to use OpenStreetMap for offline functionality, allowing the application to run without an internet connection.
  
## Excel File Upload
- Users can upload an Excel file containing location data (pincode, latitude, longitude, etc.).
- The system automatically reads the data from the file and stores it in a local SQLite database.
- Users can also remove the uploaded file and update the data accordingly.

## Database Integration
- By default, the project uses SQLite as the backend database to store location data.
- The project can be integrated with other databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, depending on the requirements.

## Project Structure
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Front-end layout for the search form and map display.
- **Python/Django**: Backend logic for handling user requests, file uploads, and database interaction.
- **Google Maps API**: For displaying the location based on user searches.
- **OpenStreetMap (Optional)**: Offline alternative for displaying maps.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Django Framework)
- SQLite (default database)
- Google Maps API
- OpenStreetMap (Offline Map)
- Bootstrap (for responsive front-end design)
- Pandas (for handling Excel file uploads)
- Folium (for map generation and markers in offline mode)

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with other databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL for scalable solutions.
- Implementing more detailed data visualizations based on the uploaded data.
- User authentication and role-based access control to manage different levels of access to the data.
